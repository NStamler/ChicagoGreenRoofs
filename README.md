### Monitoring Data

Name | Type | Measured parameter | Spatial resolution | Time resolution | Comments
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
AirNow | EPA's sensor network | Criteria pollutants | Sensor location | Hourly data | Limited spatial coverage
AoT | Sensor network | NO2, O3, H2S, CO, SO2, PM (~10% of nodes) | Sensor location | ~30 seconds | Non-calibrated air quality data
AirCasting | Personal monitoring | PM, Sound level, Relative humidity, Temperature | User location (fixed or mobile session) | 1s for mobile session, 1mn for fixed session | Low-cost sensor (non-reliable data)

## Resources
### Trainings From the University of Chicago GeoDaCenters's [OpenAirQ-phase1](https://github.com/GeoDaCenter/OpenAirQ-phase1)
[NASA Applied Remote Sensing Training](https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov) (ARSET) program offers satellite remote sensing training that builds the skills to integrate NASA Earth Science data into an agencyâ€™s decision-making activities. Trainings are offered in air quality, climate, disaster, health, land, water resources, and wildfire management.
